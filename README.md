## üçè Apple-Inspired Animated Notifications

This app uses a custom AnimatedToaster notification system with Framer Motion for beautiful, Mac-like bounce and pop effects. Notifications appear in the top-right with glassmorphism, shadow, and smooth transitions.

- Trigger notifications anywhere using the `useAnimatedToaster` hook and `showToast` function.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  const { showToast } = useAnimatedToaster();
  showToast({ type: "success", title: "Welcome!", message: "You have logged in." });
  ```
- Login/logout and other key actions are animated for a delightful user experience.

### Custom Animation
- Notification entrance: bounce-in
- Icon: pop-in
- Fully responsive and dark mode ready

### How to Customize
- Edit `src/components/ui/AnimatedToaster.tsx` for logic and style.
- Animation CSS is in `src/index.css`.
- Place the `<AnimatedToaster toasts={toasts} />` component at the root of your app.
