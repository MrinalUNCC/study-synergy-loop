## Running the Groq Server

The application uses a Groq proxy server to handle AI-powered recommendations securely. Follow these steps to run the server:

### Prerequisites
1. Obtain a Groq API key from [Groq Cloud](https://console.groq.com)
2. Set up your environment variable:
```sh
# Create a .env file in the root directory
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Starting the Server
Run the Groq server using:
```sh
npm run groq:server
```

The server will start on port 4001 by default. You can modify the port by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

### Server Details
- **Endpoint**: POST `/api/groq`
- **Port**: 4001 (default)
- **CORS**: Enabled for cross-origin requests
- **Authentication**: Requires Groq API key in environment variables

## üçè Apple-Inspired Animated Notifications

This app uses a custom AnimatedToaster notification system with Framer Motion for beautiful, Mac-like bounce and pop effects. Notifications appear in the top-right with glassmorphism, shadow, and smooth transitions.

- Trigger notifications anywhere using the `useAnimatedToaster` hook and `showToast` function.
- Example:
  ```tsx
  const { showToast } = useAnimatedToaster();
  showToast({ type: "success", title: "Welcome!", message: "You have logged in." });
  ```
- Login/logout and other key actions are animated for a delightful user experience.

### Custom Animation
- Notification entrance: bounce-in
- Icon: pop-in
- Fully responsive and dark mode ready

### How to Customize
- Edit `src/components/ui/AnimatedToaster.tsx` for logic and style.
- Animation CSS is in `src/index.css`.
- Place the `<AnimatedToaster toasts={toasts} />` component at the root of your app.

## Using the Devfile for Development

This project includes a devfile.yaml that allows you to quickly set up a consistent development environment. The devfile defines all the necessary tools and commands to build and test the code as you generate it.

### What is a Devfile?

A devfile is a YAML configuration file that defines a portable development environment. It's designed to work with cloud development platforms like OpenShift DevSpaces, GitHub Codespaces, and other cloud IDEs.

### Available Commands

The devfile includes the following commands:

- **install-dependencies**: Installs all project dependencies
- **start-dev**: Starts the development server
- **build**: Builds the production version of the application
- **build-dev**: Builds the development version of the application
- **lint**: Runs ESLint for code quality
- **run-tests**: Runs all tests using Vitest
- **build-server**: Builds the server components
- **start-server**: Starts the server
- **start-groq-server**: Starts the Groq proxy server

### Using the Devfile

1. **With a compatible IDE or platform**:
   - Open the project in a devfile-compatible environment
   - The environment will automatically configure based on the devfile.yaml

2. **With OpenShift DevSpaces or CodeReady Workspaces**:
   - Import the project
   - The IDE will detect the devfile and set up the workspace

3. **With GitHub Codespaces**:
   - Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces
   - The devfile will be used to configure the environment

### Running Tests

To run tests as you develop:

```sh
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```
